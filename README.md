# list-order-drag-save
A list that can be dragged to order, whilst automatically saving to a database (mocked up - view network inspector to see what it would have done on each change).

Makes use of _jQuery_ UI 'sortable' and 'drag' helpers and _jQuery_ to handle the ajax posts.

## Requirements

- jQuery
- jQuery UI

### Nice to haves:

- Bootstrap

#### Future Improvements

Support multiple lists - It would be good if you could have two or more lists on the same page and they could all work.
